# httpmonitor
Simple monitoring of HTTP services. Sends an e-mail when the shit hits the fan. 

# Idea 
For each server: 
- list of `GET` endpoints, e.g. `/`, `/home`, `/login` 
- list of `POST` endpoints and data to use
- frequency, how often to check status
- e-mail, where to send horrifying SERVICE DOWN messages
